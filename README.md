# Titanic---Prediction-classification-
In our Titanic dataset project, we predicted passenger survival using machine learning. We cleaned the data, handled missing values, and engineered features like FamilySize. After exploratory analysis, we trained models, with Random Forests achieving 80% accuracy, highlighting key survival factors.
